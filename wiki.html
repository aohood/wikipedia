      <p class="p-fnt-size"><span class="bold"><a href="#">Operation Pamphlet</a></span> (24 January – 27 February 1943) was a World War II convoy that brought the Australian Army's 9th Division home from Egypt. The convoy included five transports, which were protected from Japanese warships by several Allied naval task forces during their trip across the Indian Ocean and along the Australian coastline. The Australian Government had requested an end to the Second Australian Imperial Force's role in the North African Campaign. Winston Churchill and a Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to convince the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, to withdraw the request until the Allied victory in North Africa was complete, but Curtin and Allied military leaders in the South West Pacific believed that the veteran division was needed for planned offensive operations in New Guinea. The 9th Division arrived in Australian ports with no losses from enemy action, and went on to make important contributions in New Guinea during late 1943.

              746 – 29 March 1792) was King of Sweden from 1771 until his assassination in 1792. Born in Stockholm a
              s the eldest son of King Adolf Frederick, he married Sophia Magdalena of Denmark in 1766. At the time of
               his accession, the Swedish Riksdag held more power than the monarchy but was bitterly divided between r
               ival parties. After unsuccessful attempts to mediate, Gustav seized power himself in 1772, changing the constitution in what i
               s considered a coup d'état.
               Following an attempt to form a league of princes to counter the French Revolution
               , a conspiracy formed among Swedish nobles and he was shot while attending the opera
               . He died two weeks later and was succeeded by his son Gustav Adolf.</p>
            <p class="p-fnt-size">This picture, titled King Gustav III of Sweden and his Brothers,
              is a 1771 oil-on-canvas painting by Alexander Roslin. It shows Gustav (seated, left)
              with his two brothers, Frederick Adolf (standing) and Charles (seated, right). It is
               now in the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.</p>
